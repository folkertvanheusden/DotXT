- FE289 is the check for a CGA card
  if AL = 30h at that point, it's an MDA card.  If AL = 10h or 20h it's a CGA card

	it's reading the timer in a loop, so as the timer value changes more bits get set with OR
	Folkert — Today at 10:10 PM
	@gloriouscow but isn't it resetting the counter at C12?
	gloriouscow — Today at 10:10 PM
	no? where
	Folkert — Today at 10:10 PM
	oh wait, that's it: that latching means not neccessariyl reloading & restarting the counter, it  means retrieving the count. 
	gloriouscow — Today at 10:11 PM
	it means freezing the latch register
	why they bother to do that in LSB mode i don't know
	its usually only useful for reading in LSBMSB
	i dunno how you've implemented your pit, but the way the hardware works is that all reads are through the latch register
	every tick the counting element is copied into the latch register
	until the latch command is received, then the latch register stops updating, 'freezing' the current value
	until it is read out, when it starts updating again
	so you really only have to handle the latch command in one place in you code - whether or not you update it on a tick. pretty simple
	Folkert — Today at 10:15 PM
	yes, I think I misunderstood the "latch" part. I thought that it meant something like: set value & start timer. "lost in translation" so to say.
	thanks for the explanation
	gloriouscow — Today at 10:15 PM
	also the count element is 16 bit, lsb mode doesn't change that 
	so if you set a reload value of 0 it will tick over to 65535

when re-setting timer, clear pending interrupts, but only for the timer that gets reset
