DotXT
=====

A IBM PC emulator written in C# with dotnet 9.0. It runs on Linux and probably on other C#/.NET platforms as well.


compiling the emulator
======================

* On Linux
  dotnet build -c Release
  After a while you'll find a programfile called "bin/Release/net9.0/dotxt".

* On Windows
  dotnet build -c Release
  After a while you'll find a programfile called "bin\Release\net9.0\dotxt.exe".

If you like, you can copy that dotxt(.exe) file into the demo directory.


running it
==========

dotxt -R roms/GLABIOS.ROM,f000:e000 -X harddisks/demo.vhd -p cga,vnc,5900 -R roms/ide_xt.rom,d000:0000 -R roms/GLaTICK_0.8.5_AT.ROM,d000:2000 -S -O rtc

Note that you need to use a VNC-viewer to connect to the emulator. E.g. "vncviewer localhost:0" (for example https://www.tightvnc.com/ should work).

The example above runs DotXT with:
* GLABIOS installed (-R roms/GLABIOS.ROM,f000:e000)
* an XT-IDE harddisk (-X harddisks/demo.vhd -R roms/ide_xt.rom,d000:0000)
* a CGA-adapter exported via VNC at port 5900 (-p cga,vnc,5900)
* an RTC (-O rtc -R roms/GLaTICK_0.8.5_AT.ROM,d000:2000)
* and throttles the speed to emulate a 4.77 MHz PC (-S).


If you would like MIDI-support, add "-O midi" to the command line.
Run `dotxt -h` to get a list fo commandline parameters.
In the console ("==>" on your screen), you can enter e.g. "help" to get a list of commands. For example for changing the floppy drive image for an other.
